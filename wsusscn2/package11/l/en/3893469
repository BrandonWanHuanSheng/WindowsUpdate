<LocalizedProperties><Language>en</Language><Title>IE Version Less Than 9</Title><Description>Current IE8 WU items have a bug (WinOOB 1095540) with IE8 being offered to users who are on IE version&gt;8 installed. This will turn out to be an issue when we get IE9 Beta out the door with IE8 being offered incorrectly and we’d like to address this issue for TP51. The current fix is to create an “IE version less than 9” detectoid, clone, update  and re-release the impacted IE8. </Description></LocalizedProperties>
