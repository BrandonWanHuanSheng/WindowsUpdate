<LocalizedProperties><Language>en</Language><Title>NOT Chinese Hong Kong</Title><Description>This item should be included on the CHT binary when a CHH binary also exists.  CHH receives the same updates as CHT users, with the exception of Service Packs and a few other very specific updates.  In this case, we want to deliver only the CHH version and not the CHT.</Description></LocalizedProperties>
