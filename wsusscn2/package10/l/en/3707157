The Browser Choice update, once installed, will auto launch on PCs that have the control panel location set to an EEA nation and Internet Explorer set as the default browser. Users must have administrative privileges enabled which allow them to install software on their PCs in order for the update to run and to install other browsers. Once this update is installed, it cannot be removed from the machine. It is designed to inform customers who currently have Internet Explorer set as the default browser on their computers of the other web browsers available to them.  The Browser Choice Screen directs users to a webpage from which consumers have an easy way to see what other web browsers are available, to learn about those browsers and to download and install them if they choose to do so.</Description></LocalizedProperties>
